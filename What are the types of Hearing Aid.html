        <h1>What are the types of Hearing Aid?</h1>
        <p class="what">There are lots of different types of hearing aid. The right kind for you will partly depend on your hearing loss,<br>
             but there are other things to think about, too. For example, some people like to let others know about their hearing loss<br>
              – or make a fashion statement – with a clearly visible aid. Others prefer a more discreet fitting that few will notice.<br>
               It’s a personal choice but please make better hearing your priority.

            <h2>Types of Hearing Aid</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A behind the ear (BTE)</strong> aid has two parts: the main part goes behind your ear. This is connected by a thin, clear tube to an earfitting that sits inside your ear canal. Some earfittings are made individually from ear impressions but many people now use small eartips not made individually but which fit very comfortably. </li>
                <li><strong>A receiver in the canal (RIC)</strong> aid is like a BTE aid but smaller. An almost invisible wire connects the hearing aid to a receiver (tiny loudspeaker) fitted within the earfitting sitting in your ear canal.</li>
                <li></strong>An in the ear/canal (ITE/ITC)<strong></strong> aid sits completely within your outer ear (ITE) or just inside your ear canal (ITC). </li>
                <li><strong>A completely in the canal (CIC)</strong> or <strong>invisible in the canal (IIC)</strong> aid goes deeper into the ear canal, making it nearly or wholly invisible. This is the most discreet kind of hearing aid but such tiny hearing aids may have hearing limitations for you. </li>
