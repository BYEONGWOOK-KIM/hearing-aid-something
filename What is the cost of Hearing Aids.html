        <h1>What is the cost of Hearing Aids?</h1>
        <p class="what">The NHS can provide hearing aids at no charge on a long-term loan and all the extra support <br>
            (appointments, tests, and consultations) is also free. You can usually get replacement batteries free of charge from<br>
             your NHS audiology clinic. You might be charged for lost or damaged hearing aids.
            <br>
            The cost of hearing aids and professional services from a private audiologist can vary a lot, depending on the technology,<br>
             fitting style, accessories and your individual needs. It could be anywhere from <strong>£300 to £3,000</strong>.
            <br>
            Your audiologist will ensure that you have a full understanding of the cost and all the services which are included.<br>
             Most professional services and aftercare are included in the cost of hearing aids from private audiologists.  
            <br>
            It’s important to make sure that any price comparisons between different private providers are like for like. <br>
            Some professionals include a wider range of services than others and it’s particularly important to know what<br>
             services you’ll have access to after your hearing aid has been fitted.  </p>
